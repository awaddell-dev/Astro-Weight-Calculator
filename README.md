# Astro Weight Calculator

A client-side web application that calculates your weight on different planets using relative gravitational values. Built as part of the CCC Web 102 curriculum, this project demonstrates core front-end skills using vanilla web technologies.

---

## Features

* Calculate your weight across multiple planets
* Uses real relative gravity values
* Clean, responsive UI
* Instant results with client-side JavaScript
* No backend or database required

---

## Tech Stack

* HTML5 – structure and layout
* CSS3 – styling and layout
* JavaScript (ES6) – calculation logic and interactivity
* Node / npm – project setup and tooling

## What I Learned

* DOM manipulation with JavaScript
* Handling user input and validation
* Applying real-world data (gravity ratios) in calculations
* Structuring a small front-end project
* Using Git and GitHub for version control

---

## Future Improvements
